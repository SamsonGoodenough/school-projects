Your Name here

------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 1:

1. Did any changes have to be made to the Professor class definition 
in order to add the CAS class?

No, this is why we extend from it.

2. Do the objects print in the expected order?

Yes, ascending by surname.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 2:

1. Are there errors when attempting to override compareTo? How can they be fixed?

Yes there are errors, simply remove the @Override and compareTo only other CAS objects (overloading)

2. Do the comparisons between two different object types work as expected?

Yes, they only compare the surname and forename, ignoring term.

3. Do the comparisons between two CAS objects work as expected?

Yes, it compares them based on the term

------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 3:

1. Can all of these objects be added? If not, what errors are generated?

None of the Person objects can be added, error is:
The method add(CAS) in the type TreeSet<CAS> is not applicable for the arguments (Person)

2. For the objects that can be added, what happens when you attempt to print 
them? Why do you think you get the results you do?

Only the first gets printed since TreeSets won't add duplicates and cas1 and cas2 are duplicates other than their term
