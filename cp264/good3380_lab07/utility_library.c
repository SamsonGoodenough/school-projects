// last line of the buffer is printed, or the first NULL line is encountered.

// Because program execution is stopped, or aborted, under "our" control, rather than a program crash, we refer to this
// type of action as "Graceful Program Termination".
// The only house-keeping duty performed presently, before EXITING to the Operating System (OS), is to print the
// subprogram "call list", as shown below. However, in typical "well written" professional application some of the
// duties charged to this type of routine would be:
//      - ROLL Back any "uncommitted" Data Base changes.
//      - Disconnect from the Data Base(s).
//      - Free any dynamically allocated memory.
//      - Close ALL opened input and output files.
//      - Notify any external system and/or supervisor that a FATAL error has occurred and the program task has not COMPLETED
//        as expected.  This would be a welcomed message/wake-up call if the aborted program is a mission critical application
//        such as a Payroll program that MUST complete successfully in order for employees to get paid on time!
